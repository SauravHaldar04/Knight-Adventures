## Personal Note

This project was a great learning experience for me as I delved into the basics of game development using the Godot engine. Through this project, I gained valuable insights into game design, scene management, scripting with GDScript, and various game mechanics. I'm grateful for the opportunity to create Knight Adventures, and I hope you enjoy playing it as much as I enjoyed making it!

Thank you for playing Knight Adventures! We hope you have a fantastic time on your quest to rescue the princess!
